## Prompt

/sp.tasks Context for task generation: # Tasks — Todo App (Next.js + localStorage) This file breaks the Plan into small, actionable tasks suitable for one-person work or small PRs. Each task includes a description, acceptance criteria, estimated files changed/created, and an estimated effort/PR size (S/M/L). --- ## How to use this list * Implement tasks in the given order for a fast MVP. * Keep PRs small: one feature per PR is ideal. * Tag PRs with `speckit/mvp` and include a short demo GIF or screenshots for the client. --- ## Task 0 — Repo scaffold (PR 1) **Description:** Initialize the repository with Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, GitHub Actions, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, optional Husky + lint-staged hooks, and basic PR/issue templates. **Acceptance Criteria:** * `package.json` with scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `test`, `format`). * `tsconfig.json` with `strict: true`. * Tailwind configured and global stylesheet added. * ESLint + Prettier config files present. * `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig` added. * Optional: Husky + lint-staged configured for pre-commit lint/format. * Default issue template and PR template added. * Basic GitHub Actions workflow (`lint`, `test`, `build`). **Files changed/created (est.):** 12–16 (package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, .eslintrc, .prettierrc, .editorconfig, .gitignore, husky config, lint-staged config, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, .github/workflows/ci.yml, styles/globals.css) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 1 — Storage adapter & models (PR 2) **Description:** Implement `lib/storage.ts` and the Todo model utilities (create, validate, load, save, migration helpers). Use versioned key `speckit_todos_v1`. **Acceptance Criteria:** * `lib/storage.ts` exposes: `loadTodos()`, `saveTodos(todos)`, `createTodo(payload)`, `updateTodo(todo)`, `deleteTodo(id)`, `seedDemoTodosIfEmpty()`. * Includes safe JSON parse with fallback and migration stub. * Unit tests for `loadTodos`, `saveTodos`, `createTodo` using Jest. **Files changed/created (est.):** 3–5 (`lib/storage.ts`, `__tests__/storage.test.ts`, optionally `lib/todoModel.ts`) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 2 — App shell & layout (PR 3) **Description:** Create the main app shell and layout: `pages/_app.tsx`, `pages/index.tsx`, `components/Header.tsx`, and `styles/globals.css` integration. **Acceptance Criteria:** * App loads without errors. * Header shows app title and placeholder for search & theme toggle. * Root container uses Tailwind, responsive layout. **Files changed/created (est.):** 4–6 (`pages/_app.tsx`, `pages/index.tsx`, `components/Header.tsx`, `styles/globals.css`) **PR size:** S --- ## Task 3 — TodoForm component (PR 4) **Description:** Build `TodoForm.tsx` with fields (title, description, dueDate, priority, tags). Enforce validation (trim, max lengths). On submit call storage/create flow. **Acceptance Criteria:** * Form validates title and description length. * Submit creates a new todo in state and persists. * Keyboard: Enter adds when title focused. **Files changed/created (est.):** 2 (`components/TodoForm.tsx`, small update to `pages/index.tsx` to wire) **PR size:** S --- ## Task 4 — TodoList + TodoItem (PR 5) **Description:** Implement `TodoList.tsx` and `TodoItem.tsx`. Render list, show priority, tags as `TagBadge`, support inline title edit (double-click), checkbox to toggle complete, delete action, and overdue highlight. **Acceptance Criteria:** * List renders todos from storage. * Toggle complete updates todo and persists. * Inline title edit function (double-click → input → blur/Enter to save). * Tag badges are clickable and trigger tag filter. * Overdue items visually highlighted. **Files changed/created (est.):** 4 (`components/TodoList.tsx`, `components/TodoItem.tsx`, `components/TagBadge.tsx`, update `pages/index.tsx` wiring) **PR size:** L --- ## Task 5 — EditModal component (PR 6) **Description:** Implement `EditModal.tsx` to edit full todo fields (title, description, dueDate, priority, tags). Validate inputs and update storage on save. **Acceptance Criteria:** * Modal opens with existing todo data, allows edits, saves updates to storage and triggers re-sort. * Esc closes modal without saving. **Files changed/created (est.):** 2–3 (`components/EditModal.tsx`, update `components/TodoItem.tsx` to open modal) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 6 — Filters, Sort & Search (PR 7) **Description:** Implement filter controls (All/Active/Completed), sort controls (Newest/Due Date/Priority), and search input (search title/description/tags). Persist filter & sort in storage; search does not persist. **Acceptance Criteria:** * UI controls for filter + sort + search present and functional. * Filter+sort persist between reloads; search resets. * Sequence: Filter → Search → Sort applied. **Files changed/created (est.):** 3 (`components/FilterBar.tsx`, update `pages/index.tsx`, utility functions) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 7 — Settings Panel & Dark Mode (PR 8) **Description:** Add `SettingsPanel.tsx` with theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts help, and “Reset demo data” action. Implement dark mode via `useTheme()` and persist preference. **Acceptance Criteria:** * Theme toggling updates UI and persists to storage. * Settings panel shows keyboard shortcuts and a reset button that clears todos and seeds demo data. **Files changed/created (est.):** 3 (`components/SettingsPanel.tsx`, `lib/theme.ts`, small CSS updates) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 8 — Keyboard Shortcuts (PR 9) **Description:** Implement global keyboard handlers: Enter (add when title focused), Esc (close modal), Cmd/Ctrl+K (focus search). Use a small helper hook `useShortcuts()`. **Acceptance Criteria:** * Shortcuts work across pages and contexts. * Clear docs in Settings panel. **Files changed/created (est.):** 2 (`hooks/useShortcuts.ts`, minor wiring in `pages/_app.tsx`) **PR size:** S --- ## Task 9 — Tests & Accessibility (PR 10) **Description:** Add Jest tests for storage utilities and a couple of component tests for `TodoForm` and `TodoList`. Run basic axe checks locally and fix major issues. **Acceptance Criteria:** * Unit tests for `lib/storage.ts` pass. * At least 2 component tests pass. * No critical axe violations in main page. **Files changed/created (est.):** 4–6 (`__tests__/...`, test utils, jest config) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 10 — Polish & Responsive QA (PR 11) **Description:** Final UI polish: spacing, focus states, mobile adjustments, small animations, and collection of screenshots/GIFs for README/PRs. **Acceptance Criteria:** * App looks good on mobile and desktop. * Keyboard navigation is complete. * Provide demo GIF and screenshots in PR. **Files changed/created (est.):** varies (CSS, minor component tweaks) **PR size:** M --- ## Task 11 — Prepare README, LICENSE, CI, Deploy (PR 12) **Description:** Add README with run/deploy instructions, add MIT license, add CONTRIBUTING guidelines, finalize GitHub Actions, add convenience npm scripts (`seed:demo`, `reset:storage`), include PR/issue templates, and deploy to Vercel. **Acceptance Criteria:** * README includes run, build, test, and deploy steps. * LICENSE is MIT. * CONTRIBUTING.md added with branch naming guidance (`feature/*`, `fix/*`) and review requirements. * NPM scripts `seed:demo` and `reset:storage` added. * Default PR and issue templates present. * CI workflow green on main branch. * Deployed site available on Vercel. * Demo todos seeded automatically (5 items including Ted Menden & Chad CN). **Files changed/created (est.):** 8–12 (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, npm script updates in package.json, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, environment docs) **PR size:** S --- ## Optional / Future Tasks (not required for MVP) * Add drag-and-drop ordering (react-beautiful-dnd) — large task * Add Supabase backend and auth — large effort * Add E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress — medium to large * Add analytics hooks and opt-in telemetry — small --- ## Estimated total effort * Roughly **11–14 PRs** depending on how granular you split work. * Core MVP (Tasks 0–8 + 10–11) should be achievable in **2–4 developer days** for an experienced frontend dev, or about **1–2 weeks** including testing, polish, and review. ---

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the "Todo App MVP" feature.

- **Tasks File**: `specs/001-todo-app-mvp/tasks.md`

The file contains a detailed, sequential breakdown of all implementation steps, from repository setup to final deployment. The tasks are grouped by phases corresponding to expected Pull Requests.

The project is now ready for implementation. You can start with the first task, `T001`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully generated a detailed, sequential task list for implementing the Todo App MVP.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md by reformatting the user's provided task breakdown into the required checklist structure.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` or begin implementing the tasks manually starting with T001.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided a complete task list, which was more effective than generating one from scratch. The main work was reformatting and structuring it according to the template rules. Reconciling the user's PR-based structure with the template's user-story-based structure was the key decision.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The prerequisite check script failed to identify `spec.md` and `plan.md`, requiring me to manually specify their paths.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve the prerequisite check script to reliably find all relevant design documents.
